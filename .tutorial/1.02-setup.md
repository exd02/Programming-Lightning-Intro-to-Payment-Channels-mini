#  Environment Setup

For some of the exercises we will need bitcoind running.  The binaries, configurations, and some helpful aliases are all available as part of the replit environment. 

👉 Run this in your **Shell** to get your environment set up:
```
./start.sh
```

If you're curious, the `./start.sh` does the following:

- It checks to see if bitcoind is already running. If not, it starts bitcoind on regtest.
  
- If needed, it creates a bitcoin core wallet and mines some blocks so we have bitcoin to use.

  <summary>What is bitcoind?</summary>

**bitcoind** is a **daemon** (background process) that runs Bitcoin Core on your computer or, in this case, within this workbook. A background process operates quietly behind the scenes, without requiring direct user interaction. For **bitcoind**, this means running a full Bitcoin node to handle tasks like validating new blocks, propagating transactions to other peers, and storing newly validated blocks and UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) for us. Our Bitcoin daemon also includes a **command-line interface** (**CLI**) that lets us interact with the node. For example, we can use it to sign transactions with Bitcoin Core’s wallet features, broadcast transactions, retrieve mempool information, and much more.

To interact with **bitcoind**, you’d typically type `bitcoin-cli` in your terminal followed by a command. However, for this workshop, we’ll use some aliases to make communicating with Bitcoin Core easier and faster (more on this soon!).

### Notification that Bitcoind is already running

## (Optional) Turn Off Automatic Webview
When we start Bitcoin Core, Replit detects that a port has been opened, so it opens a "Webview". You can easily close this window and move on with the rest of the course. However, if you'd like to stop Replit from automatically opening a "Webview", you can follow the below steps. Note, this will turn off webviews from oppening across ***all*** of your Repls, so make sure to turn it back on if you need it later.

#### Step 1: Open User Settings
Click to open a new tab and search for "User Settings". Once you see it, click it to open the User Settings options.

</p>

#### Step 2: Disable Automatic Webview
Scroll towards the bottom of User Settings, and you should see "Automatic Webview". Click the toggle such that the toggle is **not** blue anymore.

#  Testing
As we continue through this workshop, we'll build our intuition of how Lightning works by implementing various functions. To provide a better learning experience, each function has a test associated with it. If your implementation is correct, you should see that you've passed the test for that function.

To run the tests, you will click the green "play" button at the top left of this Repl.

<p align="center" style="width: 50%; max-width: 300px;">
  <img src="./tutorial_images/run.png" alt="run" width="50%" height="auto">
</p>

Once you click it, a **Console** tab should open (if it wasn't open already), and you will see the result of the tests. If you do this now, you should see that all tests are failing! This makes sense, since we have not yet implemented any functions.

##  If you see this error...
Chances are pretty good that your Replit will go idle when completing this workshop. When this happens, Replit may shut down Bitcoin Core in an effort to reduce resource usage, since it assumes you're no longer here. This is much more likely to happen if you have a free account.

If this happens to you, you'll notice it because, when you click "Run", you'll see the below error.

<p align="center" style="width: 50%; max-width: 300px;">
  <img src="./tutorial_images/error.png" alt="error" width="100%" height="auto">
</p>

If this happens, no need to worry! Just head over to your **Shell** and restart Bitcoin Core via the below command.

```
./start.sh
```
