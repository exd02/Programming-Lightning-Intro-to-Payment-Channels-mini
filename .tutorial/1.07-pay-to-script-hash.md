# Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash (P2WSH)

As we dive into the Lightning Network, we're going to heavily rely on **Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash** (**P2WSH**) outputs, so it's helpful to review them first.

In a **P2WSH** output, bitcoin is "locked" to the SHA256 hash of a script. The script specifies the conditions that must be met to spend the bitcoin, and it can encode some pretty complex spending conditions.

To unlock the bitcoin, the spender must provide:
- The original (unhashed) **Witness Script** that, when hashed, matches the hash of our original script.
- Any other data that the Witness script specifies, such as a valid **signature**, **preimage**, etc.)

## Locking To Multisig
To build our intuition of a **P2WSH** script, let's walk through an example where we'd like to lock our funds such that multiple signatures are required to spend those funds.

Multiple signature (multi-sig) outputs are fairly common in Bitcoin and involve locking Bitcoin such that a predefined number of valid signatures from a group of public keys are required to spend the funds. This is often referred to as an **"T-of-N" scheme**, where **T** represents the number of required signatures ("threshold") and **N** is the total number of possible public keys that can be provided.

In the below example, we lock our bitcoin such that two signatures must be presented to spend the funds.

To spend from this output, we'd have to provide valid signatures for each public key and the original witness script within our **witness stack**.

#### Question: Why is there an `OP_0` in front of the first signature?
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

There is a bug in the `OP_CHECKMULTISIG` opcode that will remove an extra item from the stack during script evaluation. To ensure that our script still executes correctly, we'll need to add an `OP_0`, which is effectively a dummy value that can be safely removed from the stack without impacting the rest of our evaluation logic.

## Witness vs Output Script
Before moving on, it's worth bringing extra attention to the difference between the **witness script** and the **output script**, as these terms will come up frequently during the workshop and exercises.

- The **witness script** is the script that defines the locking condition for a **P2WSH** output. For pre-segwit **Pay-To-Script-Hash** (**P2SH**) outputs, this is called the "Redeem Script". In this example below, the "witness script" the script defining the multisig condition.
- The **output script** is the script that is placed in the `scriptPubKey` field. For a Pay-To-Witness-Script-Hash output, it's the 32-byte SHA256 hash of the witness script, preceded by `OP_0`.

### ⚡️ Build 2-of-2 Multisig Witness Script

Let's build a function that takes in two Bitcoin public keys and returns a **two of two multisig** script. In this case, this script will be our **Witness Script**. For this function to pass, you must sort the public keys such that `pubkey1` is *first* and is the lexicographically lesser of the two funding_pubkey in compressed format. You can assume that the the public keys are the following:
- `pubkey1`: `0x0252972572d465d016d4c501887b8df303eee3ed602c056b1eb09260dfa0da0ab2`
- `pubkey2`: `0x027b83ad6afb1209f3c82ebeb08c0c5fa9bf6724548506f2fb4f991e2287a77090`

It may not be obvious why this matters for Lightning, but it will become clear later!

You can find this exercise at the top of `src/exercises/exercises.rs`.

```rust
pub fn two_of_two_multisig_witness_script(
    pubkey1: &PublicKey,
    pubkey2: &PublicKey,
) -> ScriptBuf {
    
    // build 2-of-2 multisig script
  
    // to push int to stack, you can use
      // push_int(2)
      // push_opcode(use opcodes::OP_PUSHNUM_2)
  
    // opcodes::OP_CHECKMULTISIG
}
```

First, let's review what a public key really is... In the context of Bitcoin, a public key is a point on the secp256k1 elliptic curve. Like all points on 2-dimensional curves, the public key can be represented sa an X, Y coordinate.

Furthermore, instead of representing each X and Y coordinate as 256-bit numbers, we can represent them as 32-byte hexademical values. Since the elliptic curve is symetrical around the X axis, we can actually get rid of the X coordinate and, instead, use a single byte **prefix**. `0x02` represents and even Y coordinate and `0x03` represents an odd Y coordinate. By using hexadecimal values and prefixes, we create a **compressed** version of our public key, communicating all of the necessary information but taking up less space as an X, Y coordinate of 256-bit numbers in decimal format.

To determine which public key is lexicographically smaller, we can compare their byte arrays sequentially from left to right: at the first differing byte, the one with the lower value is considered smaller.

  In Rust, functions start with the `fn` keyword, followed by the function name, parameters, and return type. For example, in `two_of_two_multisig_witness_script`, `pubkey1` and `pubkey2` are parameters, each of type `&PublicKey` (a reference to a `PublicKey`). The `-> ScriptBuf` keyword specifies that the function returns a `ScriptBuf`.

```rust
pub fn two_of_two_multisig_witness_script(
    pubkey1: &PublicKey,
    pubkey2: &PublicKey,
) -> ScriptBuf {
}
```

Inside a function, you can define local variables using `let`. In Rust, the last expression in a function is returned by default if it doesn’t end with a semicolon (`;`). For example, in the below function, we are defining a variable that is 1 more than the provided number. We then return that variable from the function.

```rust
pub fn add_1(num: u32) -> u32 {
    let num_plus_one = num + 1;
    num_plus_one // This value is returned automatically
}
```

For this exercise, and a few to come, we're going to be using **rust-bitcoin**. rust-bitcoin is a comprehensive library for building Bitcoin applications in Rust, providing tools for building transactions, keys, scripts, and other core Bitcoin primitives. You can read about it [here](https://docs.rs/bitcoin/latest/bitcoin/).

rust-bitcoin provides a `Builder` [object](https://docs.rs/bitcoin/latest/bitcoin/blockdata/script/struct.Builder.html) we can use to construct a `ScriptBuf`, which represents a Bitcoin script. It offers a handful of helper functions for adding opcodes, integers, bytes, and keys to a script:
<br/>

* `Builder::new()` - construct a new builder object
* `.push_opcode(op)` - add an opcode to the script
* `.push_int(num)` - add a number to the script
* `.push_key(public_key)` - add a `PublicKey` to the script
* `.push_slice(data)` - add some arbitrary data, such as a hashed pubkey, to the script
* `.into_script()` - return the resulting `ScriptBuf` from the `Builder`  


For example, we could build a Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash script like this:

```rust
pub fn p2wpkh(
    pubkey_hash: &WPubkeyHash,
) -> ScriptBuf {
    Builder::new()
      .push_opcode(opcodes::OP_DUP)
      .push_opcode(opcodes::OP_HASH160)
      .push_slice(pubkey_hash)
      .push_opcode(opcodes::OP_EQUALVERIFY)
      .push_opcode(opcodes::OP_CHECKSIG)
      .into_script()
}
```

You can see we use `Builder::new()` to construct a new empty Builder object. From there we can chain calls to `push_opcode` and `push_slice` to build up the script we want. Finally, we call the `into_script()` method to convert the `Builder` into the `ScriptBuf` that our function needs to return.
